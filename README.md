# increasingRespawnTimes

Replaces fixed respawn timer with a function that can be customised.  
This is intended to limit game lengths without needing tickets.  
- The best thing about tickets is the exciting last stands.  
- The worst thing about tickets is the long boring last stands.
This mod is intended to remove the worst thing, but keep the best thing.  
There can still be an exciting last stand when most of the team is dead, but if it is just a stalemate the rest of the team will respawn eventually.  
Another idea I had for solving this problem was having a special respawn mechanism when there is 0 tickets.  
- If no players on a team die for 60 seconds then one of their dead players will respawn.
- Players just have a normal respawn timer which becomes much larger as soon as tickets run out.  
- Players drop loot such as bombs on death when their team is out of tickets
- Players could gain more money when the other team is out of tickets
